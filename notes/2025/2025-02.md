## TSC elections results (2m, Host)

- [Election issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1612)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
  </span>
- Might want to reschedule the voting window so that it doesn’t happen during
  the holidays.
- There is now a handbook for TSC members. Should it be public?
- There is a GH group for TSC emeritus (+Discord too)
- Security should stay private. TSC emeritus can have access but are not
  expected to drive the topics.

## Announce the new[ Community WG](https://github.com/graphql/community-wg)? (5m, Uri)

- Uri: New working group; first meeting is coming up next week.
- Two goals:
  - Add more transparency
  - Empower the community
- It's a broad scope. It's for things that don't fit into the technical working
  groups - for example improvements to docs/website, gatherings, social media
  posts, channels like Discord/Slack, etc.
- It will run in the same way as the other WGs
- Thinking about community growth, messaging to our community and to other
  communities
- In the first meeting we'll discuss how often we should meet.
- Come, join, influence the future of this WG!
- Lee: we have the separation of GraphQL technical work being open and community
  first, and prioritising what's best for the community overall rather than
  what's best for a particular vendor; and the Foundation dealing with
  non-technical work only. But the non-technical work shouldn't be
  Foundation-only - so it's exciting we're opening this up and pulling the
  community and foundation board together.

## Archive[ GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground)? (5m, Benjie)

- Intent: GraphiQL would have options so that Playground would be a thin layer
  on top of GraphiQL.
- Last commit on Playground was 3 years ago but we still have issues getting
  opened.
- Uri: GraphiQL should support most of the features of playground but not 100%
  sure
- Benjie: navigation through the docs are probably possible but it’s mostly
  styling.
- Lee: if we had maintainers, would we still have this vision of sharing the
  code between GraphiQLvs Playground
- Lee: we could add a big banner with a big warning and a call for maintainers
- Michael: What is the value of having 2 different things?
- Benjie: If we keep Playground, we would probably write it on top of GraphiQL
- Playground is basically a “ready to go” preset of GraphiQL
- Michael: We don’t want to split the maintainer work.
- Benjie: Does anyone have instructions how to move to GraphiQL? We could add
  those instructions to the repo.
- Martin: can we archive and then de-archive if needed
- Lee: yes we can

## Defer/Stream updates (20m, Rob)
